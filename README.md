# iOS Machine Learning Project - MobileNetV2 Integration

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in iOS applications by integrating **MobileNetV2**, a pre-trained image classification model, using **Core ML**. The app can classify images into predefined categories in real-time, leveraging on-device machine learning to enhance performance and privacy.

## Features:
- **Core ML Integration**: Utilizes the `MobileNetV2.mlmodel` for image classification tasks.
- **On-device machine learning**: All predictions are processed locally on the device, ensuring fast responses and user privacy.
- **Swift-based iOS App**: The project is built using **Swift** and **Xcode**, ensuring full compatibility with the latest iOS versions.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI that allows users to select images and see real-time classification results.

## Project Structure:
- **AppDelegate.swift**: Contains the main application setup code.
- **SceneDelegate.swift**: Manages the lifecycle of the app's scenes, a key feature for multi-window iOS applications.
- **ViewController.swift**: The main logic of the app resides here, handling user interactions and the Core ML model inference.
- **MobileNetV2.mlmodel**: The pre-trained machine learning model for image classification, integrated using Core ML.

## Requirements:
- **Xcode 13** or later
- **iOS 14** or later
- A real iOS device is recommended for testing machine learning models due to performance considerations.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
