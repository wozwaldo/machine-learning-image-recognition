# machine-learning-image-recognition
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in iOS applications by integrating **MobileNetV2**, a pre-trained image classification model, using **Core ML**. The app can classify images into predefined categories in real-time, leveraging on-device machine learning to enhance performance and privacy.
